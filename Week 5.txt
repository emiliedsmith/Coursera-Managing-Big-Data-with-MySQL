Week 5
Exercise 1. How many distinct dates are there in the saledate column of the transaction
table for each month/year combination in the database? 

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT saledate) AS numofdates, EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate) AS month_num, EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate) AS Year_num
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY Year_num, month_num
ORDER BY Year_num, month_num;

Exercise 2. Use a CASE statement within an aggregate function to determine which sku
had the greatest total sales during the combined summer months of June, July, and August. 

SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate)=6 THEN amt ELSE 0 END) AS June_sale, SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate)=7 THEN amt ELSE 0 END) AS July_sale, SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate)=8 THEN amt ELSE 0 END) AS Aug_sale, June_sale+July_sale+Aug_sale AS Summer_sale, sku
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype='P'
GROUP BY sku
ORDER BY Summer_sale DESC;

Exercise 3. How many distinct dates are there in the saledate column of the transaction
table for each month/year/store combination in the database? Sort your results by the
number of days per combination in ascending order. 

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT saledate) AS numofdates, store, EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate) AS month_num, EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate) AS Year_num
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY store, Year_num, month_num
ORDER BY numofdates;

Exercise 4. What is the average daily revenue for each store/month/year combination in
the database? Calculate this by dividing the total revenue for a group by the number of
sales days available in the transaction table for that group. 

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT t.saledate) AS numofdates, t.store, EXTRACT(YEAR from t.saledate)||EXTRACT(MONTH from t.saledate) AS year_month, SUM(t.amt) / numofdates AS Daily_Average_Revenue
FROM trnsact t INNER JOIN store_msa s ON t.store=s.store 
WHERE stype='P' AND saledate < '2005-08-01'
GROUP BY t.store, year_month
ORDER BY year_month DESC
HAVING numofdates >= 20 ;

Exercise 5. What is the average daily revenue brought in by Dillard’s stores in areas of
high, medium, or low levels of high school education? 

SELECT CASE WHEN s.msa_high>50.0 AND s.msa_high<60.0 THEN 'low'
            WHEN s.msa_high>60.1 AND s.msa_high<70.0 THEN 'medium'
            WHEN s.msa_high>70.0 THEN 'high' END AS Education, SUM(daily_rev.amt_sum)/SUM(daily_rev.numofdates) AS group_avg
FROM store_msa s JOIN (SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT saledate) AS numofdates, store, EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate)||EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate) AS year_month, SUM(amt) AS amt_sum
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype='P' AND saledate < '2005-08-01'
GROUP BY store, year_month
HAVING numofdates >= 20) AS daily_rev
ON s.store= daily_rev.store
GROUP BY Education;

Exercise 6. Compare the average daily revenues of the stores with the highest median
msa_income and the lowest median msa_income. In what city and state were these stores,
and which store had a higher average daily revenue? 

SELECT Top1.state, Top1.city, SUM(daily_rev.amt_sum)/SUM(daily_rev.numofdates) AS group_avg
FROM (SELECT TOP 1 msa_income, state, city, store
 FROM store_msa ORDER BY msa_income DESC) Top1 JOIN (SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT saledate) AS numofdates, store, EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate)||EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate) AS year_month, SUM(amt) AS amt_sum
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype='P' AND saledate < '2005-08-01'
GROUP BY store, year_month
HAVING numofdates >= 20) AS daily_rev
ON Top1.store= daily_rev.store
GROUP BY city, state;

SELECT low.state, low.city, SUM(daily_rev.amt_sum)/SUM(daily_rev.numofdates) AS group_avg
FROM (SELECT TOP 1 msa_income, state, city, store
 FROM store_msa ORDER BY msa_income ASC) low JOIN (SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT saledate) AS numofdates, store, EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate)||EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate) AS year_month, SUM(amt) AS amt_sum
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype='P' AND saledate < '2005-08-01'
GROUP BY store, year_month
HAVING numofdates >= 20) AS daily_rev
ON low.store= daily_rev.store
GROUP BY city, state;

Exercise 7: What is the brand of the sku with the greatest standard deviation in sprice?
Only examine skus that have been part of over 100 transactions. 

SELECT t.sku, STDDEV_SAMP(t.sprice) AS STDSPrice, s.brand, COUNT(t.sku) AS NumofTrans
FROM trnsact t JOIN skuinfo s ON t.sku=s.sku
WHERE t.stype = 'P'
GROUP BY t.sku, brand
HAVING NumofTrans > 100
ORDER BY STDSPrice DESC;

Exercise 8: Examine all the transactions for the sku with the greatest standard deviation in
sprice, but only consider skus that are part of more than 100 transactions. 

SELECT *

WHERE sku=2762683;

GROUP BY year_month
ORDER BY Daily_Average_Revenue DESC
HAVING numofdates >= 20 ;

Exercise 10: Which department, in which city and state of what store, had the greatest %
increase in average daily sales revenue from November to December? 


SELECT d.deptdesc, s.city, s.state, Rev_change 
FROM (
  SELECT store, sku,
SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate)=11 THEN amt END) AS Nov_sale, 
SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate)=12 THEN amt END) AS Dec_sales,

count(distinct case when extract(month from saledate) = 12 then saledate end) as Dec_days, 
Nov_sale/Nov_days AS Nov_rev, 
Dec_sales/Dec_days AS Dec_rev,

FROM trnsact t
GROUP BY store, sku
WHERE t.stype='P' AND t.saledate < '2005-08-01'

average daily revenue from August to September? 


SELECT s.city, s.state, Rev_change
